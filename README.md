# RobotArduBlockly
This is a fork of the Blockly for senseBox. It includes blocks to control motors that are connected via an Adafruit motor shield V1 for Arduino. One of these robots is the [SMARS](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828). This is work in progress and by no means bug free:-)

# Blockly for senseBox
Blockly for senseBox is a visual programming editor for the senseBox:edu. It is based on Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) and carlosperates [Ardublockly](https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly), which has been forked.

## Features
* Generates Arduino code with visual drag-and-drop blocks
* online Compiler for the senseBox MCU
* Useful "code block warnings"
* Works online without Installation

If you find erros, enhancement or want to request new features submit a new [issue](https://github.com/sensebox/ardublockly-1/issues). 


## Running Online
1. Go to [Blockly for senseBox](https://blockly.sensebox.de/) pick the senseBox MCU.
2. Drag and Drop Blocks to the Workspace, hit compile and copy the .bin to your senseBox MCU
